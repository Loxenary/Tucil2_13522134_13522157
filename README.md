## Project Overview
This project is aimed at fulfilling the requirements for Small Task 2 of Algorithm Strategy, which involves implementing the Brute Force and Divide And Conquer algorithms in creating Bezier Curves. The implementation of Bezier Curves also includes the creation of a GUI that can display visual results of the executed algorithms.
